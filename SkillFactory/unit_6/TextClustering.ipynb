Thanks.\\n\\nI get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to\\ndeal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).\\n\\nHere is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.\\n\\nThis might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.\\n\\n\\tGraeme Gill.\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\"A note on gamma correction and images\"\\n\\nAuthor: Graeme W. Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Being a PhD-student at David\\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\\n\\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\\nretrieved from\\n\\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\\n\\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\\n\\n====================================================================\\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\\nproposed previously.\\n  \\nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \\n  \\nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\\nretaining its computational efficiency.\\n====================================================================\\n\\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \\n\\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\\npossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\\nme and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also\\nwelcome!\\n\\nStefan Brands, \\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nCWI, Kruislaan 413, 1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands \\nTel: +31 20 5924103, e-mail: brands@cwi.nl  \\n\",\n",

The Turkish government never\\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\\n\\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \\nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \\ntoo would be a forgery!.

I think this is going to be a\\ntough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of\\nresources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are\\nserious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\\nBill 266 in 1991.\\n\\nPossible actions to take in response:\\n\\n1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\\nmore.\\n\\n2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\\ntechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\\nwrite some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\\nnewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \\nRemember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\\nslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\\narcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\\nlibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \\n\\n3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\\nMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\\nSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\\ntechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.\\n\\n4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\\nwould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\\nthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\\nsurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\\nspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\\nactivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\\nthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\\nthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\\nwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\\n\\n4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\\nthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\\nexpenses and lobbying.\\n\\n5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\\ndevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\\nlobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\\ntelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\\ncoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\\npresent your company's management with a united front of engineering\\ntalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\\nmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold\\nmeetings on it.\\n\\n6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla\\ntechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,\\nanonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,\\netc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might\\nalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed\\nby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful\\ntools for these purposes. \\n\\n7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on\\nthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we\\nmay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't\\noutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of\\nthis Clipper chip plan in the end.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\\n\\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

The last move was the \\n[HE]\\tblast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to\\n[HE]\\tescape the from Lacin, a city that was \"given\" to the Kurds\\n[HE]\\tby the Armenians. \\n\\nIt has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh \\nby removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to \\npower last year, he announced he would be be \"swimming in Lake Sevan [in \\nArmeniaxn] by July\". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the \\nArmenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey \\nis going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If \\nElchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of \\nKelbajar, his people will pay the price. \\n\\nIt also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they\\nare next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just \\nlook at the situation with the Lezgians.\\n\\nAbout the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there \\nare no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can\\'t they make up their minds? Oh I see, there \\nare only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this \"60 \\nKurd refugee\" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in \\nBaku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border \\nwith Iran, and the ridiculous story of the \"intercepting\" of Armenian military \\nconversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by \\nsomebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed \\n\"special correspondent\" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!\\n\\n[h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane \\n[h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one\\n[h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane\\n[h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.\\n[h]\\n\\nNo, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.\\n\\n[HE]\\tDon\\'t speak about things you don\\'t know: 8 American Cargo planes\\n[HE]\\twere heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities\\n[HE]\\tannounced that they were going to search these cargo \\n[HE]\\tplanes 3 of these planes returned to it\\'s base in Germany.\\n[HE]\\t5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of\\n[HE]\\tof the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not\\n[HE]\\thumanitarian aid.....\\n\\nYour \"facts\" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey \\nhave been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes\\nwere searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments \\nwere held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey\\nfor the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was\\nconfiscated, other shipments were exchanged with \"crap\" and dirt, then\\nshipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don\\'t have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.\\nuses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which\\nthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish \\nchauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed \\nanything other than a paranoid Turkish military. \\n\\n[HE]\\tSearch Turkish planes? You don\\'t know what you are talking about.\\n[HE]\\tsince it\\'s content is announced to be weapons? \\n\\nWell, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan\\nfrom Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!\\n\\n[HE]\\tTurkey\\'s government has announced that it\\'s giving weapons\\n[HE]\\tto Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan\\n[HE]\\tit self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons\\n[HE]\\tsince it\\'s content is announced to be weapons? \\n\\nYou are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow\\nmoving air transports!\\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\\nS.D.P.A.

Then replace \"prince\" with\\n\"government\" or \"president\", as appropriate, and read it again.  \\n\\n[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by\\nDaniel Donno.]\\n\\n\\tIn order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\\ndisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\\ncities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\\nthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\\ninitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\\ndestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\\njudgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\\ncircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\\nnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\\nwill allow.\\n\\n\\tTo begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\\ndisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\\nproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\\narms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\\nwhile those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\\nare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\\nnonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\\nextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\\nthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\\nthe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\\nand dangers should receive advantages.  \\n\\n\\tWhen you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\\nshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\\ndistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\\nMoreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\\nhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\\ndiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\\ngood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\\nsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\\nstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\\nfull of examples proving that this is so.\\n\\n\\tBut when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\\nannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\\nthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\\nit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\\nsoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\\nthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\\nhis original domain.\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\n\\tAnd since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind\\nany prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants\\nthat he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the\\nreason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction\\nwith the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to\\nkeep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he\\nwill carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn\\nfrom ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much\\neasier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former\\ngovernment, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of\\nthose who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to\\nreplace it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I suspect that NSA\\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.

I hope that\\'s not the case, since\\nit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked\\njodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency\\nor organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used\\nto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-\\nnesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would\\ntrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for\\n(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the\\ncomplaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars\\nto build a keysearch machine for.)\\n \\n   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of\\nthe GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?

However, the system as a whole isn\\'t resistant\\nto \"practical cryptanalysis.\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how\\nseveral NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite\\nsecurity measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. \\n\\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\nlaw enforcement communications.

That is, ignoring concerns about government\\nintrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to\\ninvestigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,\\nand their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  \\n\\nA rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million\\ndollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.\\nwiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28\\nbillion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)\\nI\\'m working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but\\nI\\'d like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating\\nthe costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.\\n\\nPlease send me quotable/citeable estimates for:\\n\\n- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all\\n  phones with wiretap chips?\\n- How much would it cost to make each chip?\\n- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?\\n- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?\\n- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been\\n  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?\\n- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed\\n  \"law enforcement blocks\"?\\n- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?\\n\\nPut another way, the question I\\'m asking is, what if each police\\nagency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being\\ncharged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication\\nto be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or\\nwould they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes\\nin other ways?\\n-- \\nRobin Hanson  hanson@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov \\n415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035\\n510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921 \\n',\n",
       "  \"From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\\nSubject: Re: Minority Abuses in Greece.\\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\\nDistribution: world\\nLines: 201\\n\\nIn article <C60B63.G2M@panix.com> mpoly@panix.com (Michael S. Polymenakos) writes:\\n\\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\\non Clipper.\\n\\nThe name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\"\\n\\nMartin Hellman had written\\n\\n                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\\n                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\\n                producing\\n\\n                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n\\nTo which I responded:\\n\\n        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\\n        \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\\n        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\\n\\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\\nfor the family key SK.\\n\\n        The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\\n        Compute the 64-bit block\\n\\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\\n\\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\\n        (I\\'m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\\n        they\\'re called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\\n\\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\\nan entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\\nthrown out if desired).\\n\\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\\nfor each value).\\n\\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\\nescrow agencies.\\n\\nDorothy Denning\\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\\nwith it\\'s contents and implications.

If you are uninterested, since I will\\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\\nkill them.\\n\\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\\n\\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\\n\\n#1\\tBRIAN HAYWARD\\t\\tSeason:\\t11th\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tP (D)\\n\\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Translation of Ha\\'aretz article.\\n\\nRacism in the Knesset\\n---------------------\\n\\nCoalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs\\nfrom _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and\\nhis friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab\\npublic and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuse\\nto view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the\\ngovernment, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document\\nof intentions which included a commitment to \"work towards a decrease in\\nthe discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens\".  [Decrease WHAT?!?!\\nBut posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does\\nnot exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal].\\n\\nHowever, racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to consider\\nwho would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK\\nfrom Hadash [the Communist party, one of the \"Arab\" parties - Yigal] on\\nthe State Comptroller\\'s Committee.  And oh, did that ever stir up a\\nstorm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members\\nfind it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house\\ncommittees.  \"Security secrets\" are liable to fall into their hands...\\n\\nThis attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,\\nbeing so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people\\'s hearts -- holds\\nthat there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens\\nof thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body\\nwhich represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of\\npolitical discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but\\nof racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed\\nwas that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar\\nGojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member\\'s\\nparty which was considered unfit, but his race...\\n\\n[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]\\n\\nIt is worth noting that for the first time since the state\\'s founding, a\\npublic debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following\\narticle:\\n\\n\\nA TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE\\n\\nBy Gid\\'on Levi, Ha\\'aretz, July 26, 1992\\n\\nRevelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral\\npart of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal\\nwith them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow\\nand explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].\\nExcept that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government\\'s\\nwindow dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.\\n\\nLast week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is\\nfinding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more\\nimportant committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less\\ndifficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly\\ntwo entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.\\n\\nThe 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its\\nmembers are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least\\non one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and\\nparliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition\\nendures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees\\nof the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the\\nExternal Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.\\nWorlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not \"to\\ngive\" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller\\'s\\nCommittee.\\n\\nThe arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above\\ncommittees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an\\nArab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, but\\ntheir significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not\\nspending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over\\ninformation from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther\\nheadquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are\\ncontinually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which\\ncould safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish\\nUnderground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from\\nHadash.\\n\\nThe Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee\\non Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK\\nNawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister\\nin an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even\\na review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly\\nleaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK\\nHashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at\\nal-Najah?\\n\\nTheir non-participation [in important committees] and that of their\\ncolleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the\\nelected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for\\naddressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the\\ngovernment and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and\\nAbsorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate in\\nthe process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or\\nin the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, they\\nhave little part in that.\\n\\nLabor\\'s dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about\\nsome improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the\\nState Comptroller\\'s Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculous\\nattempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,\\nand thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,\\nbut it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional\\nbacking for such a step.\\n\\nBut not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.

I\\'ll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it\\'s a\\nbit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the\\nprotocol that\\'s followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a\\nwiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption\\nand the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is\\nsent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The\\nF-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the\\nencrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1\\nand U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.\\n\\nNote how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the\\ncops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can\\'t read other traffic.  Every\\nrequest must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The\\ncops and the FBI together can\\'t cheat, since they don\\'t have U.  (I\\nregard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the\\nsystem.  It\\'s to prevent this that I modified Alvarez\\'s scheme.)  The\\nescrow agents can\\'t read the conversation, since they don\\'t have it;\\nall they have is N and U[K].  And the police don\\'t even see N.\\n\\nIt\\'s harder to see how to block decryption of old, warrantless,\\nwiretaps.  There is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrow\\nagents that the call is current.  But that\\'s not nearly as strong.\\nThere are approaches I can see that might work, involving sequences of\\ndata on an unalterable medium, complete with cryptographic protection\\nagainst insertion onto a new medium.  But I don\\'t have anything yet\\nthat isn\\'t too complex for comfort, or too hard to install in the real\\nworld.  The NSA might have an answer; they may or may not be smarter\\nthan me, but I\\'ve been working on this for a week, and they\\'ve had years.\\n',\n",

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\\n\\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\\n\\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\\nunresolved conflict exists.\\n\\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\\nand nations.\\n\\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\\n\\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\\npolitical means have failed.\\n\\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\\n\\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\\n\\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\\n\\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\\n\\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\\n\\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\\n\\n\\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\\ngovernments and international organizations.\\n\\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\\n\\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\\nattempt to identify some of these:\\n\\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\\n\\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\\n\\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\\nabove)\\n\\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\\nattitudes.\\n\\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\\n\\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\\ndiscussion and enrichment.\\n\\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\\n\\n\",\n",

Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more.

Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, \\'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle\\', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more\\nheroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I\\nthink Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging\\na new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I\\'m not\\ngonna waiger anything on this, because I\\'ve seen some really strange\\nthings happen in both pro and college hockey.\\n\\nTalking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball\\nswing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev\\ndeflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a\\ntesiment to Buffalo\\'s ability to really be persistent and grind it out\\nin the end (something they weren\\'t necessarily in the regular season).  The\\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\\nthe opening seconds.  I don\\'t normally like penalties being called in\\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\\nwon a faceoff (they weren\\'t that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his\\nshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps\\nover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting\\nit up.  I didn\\'t realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,\\n\"They score, THEY SCORE!!!\".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping\\nup and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating\\nover to Brad May who he jumped on.\\n\\nDoug McKee\\nmckee@cs.buffalo.edu\\n',\n",

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\\n\\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\\'s data visual-\\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\\n          Starbase.\\n\\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render.

It does not go into\\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\\n---------------------\\n\\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\\n  messages with your private key.\\n\\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\\n\\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\\n\\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\\n  remain high.\\n\\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\\n----------------------\\n\\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\\n\\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don\\'t do that.  Run \\n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\\n\\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \\n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\\n\\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \\n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\\n  not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \\n  RIPEM doesn\\'t have features for doing this as automatically as\\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\\n  authentication.\\n\\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\\n----------------\\n\\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\\n  to Alice which says \"OK, let\\'s do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \\n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\\n  unknown message.\\n\\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \\n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\\n  the utils directory.\\n\\nLOCAL ATTACKS\\n-------------\\n\\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\\n  the plaintext, depending how it\\'s stored.\\n\\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\\n  passphrase.)\\n\\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there\\'s a very real trade-off between\\n  convenience and security here.\\n\\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\\n\\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you\\'ve just\\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\\n  cleartext password authentication.\\n\\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\\n\\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\\n-------------------------\\n\\n- RIPEM\\'s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \\n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\\n  forwarding functions to work.\\n \\n  Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will\\n  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware\\n  of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography\\n  can never be greater than the security of the people using it.\\n',\n",

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

Roy stood on his head \\nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \\nend-to-end. Kamensky\\'s mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \\nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall \\nfor most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero \\nbecause Roy\\'s team didn\\'t make full use of their opportunities.\\n\\nHextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very \\nwell, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over \\nBellows\\' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all \\nthose opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.\\nHextall wasn\\'t particularly brilliant on those plays ... \\n\\n>Blaming Stewart is just an\\n>excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\\n>goals he could possibly allow.

Roy played well because he wasn\\'t screened the whole night. \\nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\\n\\n>Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \\n>five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \\n>ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\n   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\n   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n   commercial use today.\\n\\n   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\n   A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n   \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   2\\n\\n\\n   \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n   in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n   wiretap.\\n\\n   The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n   new authorities to access the content of the private\\n   conversations of Americans.\\n\\n   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n   government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n   their findings.\\n\\n   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n   encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n   criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n   the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n\\t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n\\t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n\\t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n\\t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n\\t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n\\t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n\\t     technology to build the National Information\\n\\t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n\\t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n\\t     marketplace; and \\n\\n\\t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n\\t     high technology products.\\n\\n   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   3\\n\\n   The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n   sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n   (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n   programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n   system transmits voice.\\n\\n   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n   protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n   them from those who break the law.\\n\\n   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n   The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n   encryption technology are also available.  \\n\\n   For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n   ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\n   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n\\tagencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\n   A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n\\tno new authorities to access the content of the private\\n\\tconversations of Americans.\\n\\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n\\ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n\\tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n\\tdecipher the message?\\n\\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n\\tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n\\twould then present documentation of this authorization to\\n\\tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n\\tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n\\tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n\\tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n\\tescrow system.\\n\\n   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\n   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n\\tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n\\tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n\\toversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\n   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n\\thow strong the security is?  \\n\\n   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n\\tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n\\tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n\\tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n\\tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n\\tpotential users that there are no unrecognized\\n\\tvulnerabilities.\\n\\n   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\n   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n\\tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n\\tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n\\tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n\\tofficials.\\n\\n   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\n   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n\\tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n\\tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n\\tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n\\tdecisions related to this initiative.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\n   A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n\\tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n\\tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n\\tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n\\tmanufacturer that produces them.\\n\\n   Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\n   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n\\tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n\\tmanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n\\tto other vendors in the future.\\n\\n   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\n   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n\\tthe \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n\\n   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n\\tsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n\\twilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n\\tpowerful encryption devices?\\n\\n   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n\\tconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n\\tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n\\tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n\\tthan others readily available today, but it is just one\\n\\tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n\\tencryption technology, which the Administration is\\n\\tdeveloping.\\n\\n\\tThe Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n\\tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n\\twe will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n\\teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n\\tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n\\tunbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n\\tfalse \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n\\tan \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n\\tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n\\tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n\\tChip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\n   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n\\tAdministration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n\\tthat of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\n   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n\\ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n\\tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest\\n\\tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n\\tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n\\tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n\\tand terrorism.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n\\tthe government hardware?\\n\\n   A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n\\trequirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n\\trequired to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n\\tsame is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n\\tattractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n\\tto U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n\\tin mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n\\tcase-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n\\tdevices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n\\tto review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n\\tof these products.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\\nThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\\ntime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\\nattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \\nThe document below is the result of that effort. \\n\\nDorothy Denning\\n---------------\\n\\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\\n\\n                               Dorothy Denning\\n\\n                                April 19, 1993\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n\\n\\nCHIP STRUCTURE\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\\nalgorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\\n16 Mbits a second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \\n\\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\\nencrypted under the family key F.\\n\\n\\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n\\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\nMikotronx.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\\n\\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n64-bit block R1:\\n\\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\nagencies.\\n\\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\nassurance that no information is left behind.\\n \\nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\nthe escrow agencies.\\n\\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\nboth may be independent from the government.\\n\\n\\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n\\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\\nfamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\\nwarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\\nagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\\nthe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\\nFinally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\\nthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.\\n\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on\\ninformation provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to\\ndistribute this document is granted.\\n\\n\\n    \\n',\n",

An EFF Statement\\nX-Xxmessage-Id: <A7F49385AC03AC80@harding.eff.org>\\nX-Xxdate: Fri, 16 Apr 93 21:47:01 GMT\\nNntp-Posting-Host: harding.eff.org\\nOrganization: Electronic Frontier Foundation\\nX-Useragent: Nuntius v1.1.1d17\\nLines: 122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApril 16, 1993\\n\\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n\\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n\\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\nstore users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\nincorporation into its communications products.\\n\\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n\\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\ndiscussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n\\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\nmade public.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n\\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\\nDaniel J.

If it were\\npublished, one could then build physically identical clone versions\\nof the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips.  But\\nthe cloner wouldn\\'t provide the keys to the escrow houses.  Hmmn.\\n\\nOr is there a technical hack that I\\'ve missed?  E.g. how about if the\\nchips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the\\ntwo escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys, but\\nin a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses\\nbe installed as well, without which clone versions wouldn\\'t\\ninteroperate?  This is getting awfully complicated, but that\\'s\\ncrypto for you.\\n\\n-- \\nJohn R.

[1]\\n\\nBorn 1964\\nSecretary-Typist\\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\\n\\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\\nMicrodistrict No. 3\\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o\\'clock show,\\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \\naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

So the\\n  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \\n  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \"wiretaps\",\\ndetectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\\ntime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\\naid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\\ntechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\\nprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\\nliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\\nmicrophones at either end.\\n\\nIn order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\\nphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\\nthat it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \"wiretap\" chip\\nto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\\nwhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\\nannounced it would use these chips \"in all its secure telephone\\nproducts\".\\n\\nEach chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\\nbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\\neach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\\ninfo in a special \"law enforcement block\".  Law enforcement officers\\nwith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\\nindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\\non any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\\n\\nTo date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\\nsecurity.  The government won\\'t disclose the encryption algorithm, and\\nmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\\nhas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\\ninspire confidence on this point [1].\\n\\nHowever, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\\nwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\\ninvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\\ninvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\\ngive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\\nOr to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\\neach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\\nof forcing phones to support wiretaps?\\n\\nTo start to answer this question, we might compare the current\\nbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\\ncosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\\nbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\\n\\nWIRETAP BENEFITS\\n\\n1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\\n[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\\nrequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\\nwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\\nresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\\nwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\\n76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\\nregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\\nauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\\ncalls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\\naverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\\nreporting costs), mostly for labor.\\n\\nThus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\\nabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\\nleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\\ngets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\\ntotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\\nyear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\\nexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \"access\"\\nlines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\\nphone line, or about two cents a month.\\n\\nIn general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\\nof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\\nexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\\nwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\\nthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\\nwiretap a particular suspect\\'s phone, police might instead use hidden\\nmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\\nmight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\\nwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\\n\\nIf we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\\non average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\\nbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\\nof two cents a month per phone line.\\n\\nWIRETAP COSTS\\n\\nLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\\nencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\\nhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\\nears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\\ndomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\\nadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\\n\\nExtra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\\nincreasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\\nbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\\nthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\\nThe chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\\ndesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\\nprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\\n(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\\nlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\\nwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\\n\\nPerhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\\nreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\\nbe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\\nwidely believed that governments are less efficient than private\\nenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\\nperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\\nstandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\\nthey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \\n\\nCurrently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\\nU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\\naccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\\nmonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\\nas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\\nAnd this doesn\\'t even include extra costs phone owners pay because\\ntheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\\nwouldn\\'t have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\\nper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\\nphone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\\nslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\\nWhen the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\\nattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\\nBut when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\\nclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\\nwould really be less than the benefits.  \\n\\nIf consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\\ncompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\\nrate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\\nnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\\n\\n[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\\n\\n[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\\n    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\\n    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\\n\\n[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \\n\\n[4] Dorothy Denning, \"The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary\",\\n    distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993. \\n-- \\nRobin Hanson  hanson@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov \\n415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035\\n510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921 \\n',\n",

Neil Schulman\\n\\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you\\'d ring up Carl Sagan,\\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n\\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n\\nA little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\nexpertise.\\n\\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n\\nHe\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\nWebster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\nof the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n\\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\\n\\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n\\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\nsentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\nfree State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\noath to support, if necessary.\"\\n\\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\nthen concluded:\\n\\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n\\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n\\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\nmaintaining a militia.\\n\\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\nand bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\nto a right of the people.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\nthat such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\nexisting, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\nshall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\nconditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\nmilitia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\nmilitia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n\\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\nauthority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\ncontrol over the military.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\nAmendment to the following sentence,\\n\\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\ninfringed.\\'\\n\\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n\\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\nand\\n\\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\nto keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\namendment in grammatical structure.\\n\\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n\\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\nany conclusion.\"\\n\\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\nprotects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n\\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\nold guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n\\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n\\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn\\'t mean what it says it means but\\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\\n\\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\\n\\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\\ncredited.

       "  'From: ebrahim@ee.umanitoba.ca (Mohamad Ebrahimi)\\nSubject: PBS Frontline: Iran and the bomb\\nNntp-Posting-Host: ic17.ee.umanitoba.ca\\nOrganization: Elect & Comp Engineering, U of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba,Canada\\nLines: 75\\n\\n\\n       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS\\n    Frontline program regarding Iran\\'s nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday\\n    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I\\'ll present them in some separate\\n    points.\\n\\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\\n\\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah\\'s technological\\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \\n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\\n    in Iran after revolution.\\n\\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\\n\\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war.\\n\\n    - The translation of Iranian officials\\' talks are not 100% true. For\\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \\n    translator says: \" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly \\n    research.\"!\\n\\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \\n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran\\'s\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\\n\\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \\n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of Iran\\'s industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\\n\\n    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n    Iran\\'s different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA\\'s\\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq\\'s nuclear\\n    activities before\" as if they didn\\'t know that Iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons!\\n\\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge!\\n\\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\\n\\n\\nMohammad\\n\\n  \\n    [*] International Atomic Energy Agency\\n  \\n',\n",

In fact,\\nit is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany\\nround the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,\\nthen your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not\\nbe an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of \\nGreece in regard to telecommunication facilities.

The\\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\\non trial. In September \\'91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\\nthe first time in Israel\\'s history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\\n\\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter\\nof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,\\nbut also \"the culture of lies\", which Judge Landau had described in\\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \\nNothing had changed.\\n\\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK\\'s high-ranking officials was transfered\\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\n[\"The culture of lies\" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators\\'\\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\\ntortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought\\nto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --\\nthus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those\\nmethods were used to extract a confession.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.\\n\\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\\n-steveg@cadkey.com\\n\",\n",

As I stated, religion\\n\\nThere are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.\\nThe name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form \\'Armina\\'\\nor \\'Aramaniya\\' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.\\nThe following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun\\ncuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).\\n\\n 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\n 6. On reaching Arminam \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\n 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian:\\n\\nAs for \\'Armenia\\', the equivalent of the \\'Armin\\' or \\'Arminik\\' of the Persians,\\nthis is more recent than the word \\'Ararat\\', and is to be found used in\\nthe Dara inscriptions for \\'Haiastan\\'.  \\n\\nSaint Martin:\\n\\nThe name \\'Armenie\\' has been given since very early times by almost all\\nthe various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians\\nas \\'Haiastan\\'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between\\nArmenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics\\nled him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a \\ndistinct race.\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n',\n",

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\\nderived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\\nthere are only one billion possible unit keys.\\n\\n   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n   64-bit block R1:\\n\\n\\t   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n\\t   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n\\t   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n   agencies.\\n\\nHmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\\nnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\\nis an intentional way of assuring a \"fail safe\" for the government --\\nU is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\\nchange they constitute effective \"master keys\" (along with F), the\\ntheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\\ncompletely obviates the security of the system. However, more\\ninterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\\nmatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\\nand U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\\nif it NOT to provide an additional back door?\\n\\nI find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\\napproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\\nthe back of a napkin.\\n\\nEven if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\\nrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\\nassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\\ngoal is an illusion of security.\\n\\nIf S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\\nthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\\npairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\\nunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\\nsoon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\\nespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\\n-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\\nby the time we know it may be too late.\\n\\n   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\n   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\n   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\n   assurance that no information is left behind.\\n\\nNone of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\\n\"destroying the laptop\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\\nWe all know that you can\\'t read data from DRAM that has been turned\\noff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don\\'t know\\nis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\\nfirst place other than to weaken the system. We don\\'t know if the\\nagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\\ninformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\\nthe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\\nthis in a \"vault\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\\nwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\\nhigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\\nfor most of the rest of us.\\n\\n   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n   the escrow agencies.\\n\\nWhat would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\\nthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\\nhonest. Who cares?

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n',\n",

(Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\\nsomeone gets cut every period.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\\'s opinion is supported\\nby Murray.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 7.0 out of 10.\\n',\n",

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan).

Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them.

Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\\'t it declare what\\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\\'s revelations were true has no\\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\\nAs to which were and which weren\\'t, I am under no moral obligation\\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\\nhas.\\n\\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n|> \\'hidden prisoners\\' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\n|> Ma\\'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\\n\\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\n|> way to \\'cast aspersions upon Israel\\'.

Such\\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.

The problem is not that the q\\'s were provocative,\\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\\nthem as you see fit.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

The recognition of the Genocide has become an \\nissue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that \\nartificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.\\n\\n- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States \\nthat it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts \\nthe principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures \\nto the contrary.\\n\\n- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement \\nprotest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued \\ncoddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet\\nArmenia.\\n\\n- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia\\'s.\\n\\n\\nSource: \"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\" by Avetis Aharonian.

The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\\n   spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\\n   shepherds from roaming.\\n\\n   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\\n   But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\\n   Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\\n   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\\n   in order that the land could be transferred to the army.\\n\\nAnd now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:\\n\\n   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\\n   today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\\n   the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\\n   by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\\n   confined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\\n   for them.\\n\\n   (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\\n   elias@ismennt.is)\\n\\nSo what you basically say is that \"we know for sure that nothing good happens\\nthere now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived\\nand that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about\\nwhat the Jews did there.\"\\n\\nIs that what you said?

DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     \\n',\n",

Where is the logic in the \\nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \\nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \\nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \\nof Anatolia.\\n\\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \\nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\\n\\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\\n\\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \\ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \\n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\\n\\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \\nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\\n\\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \\nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \\nfacts count.\\n\\nAs for Selanik,\\n\\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\\n  the great port of Izmir.\\n\\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\\n\\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \\nI can\\'t imagine why.\\n\\n--\\nWayne Throop   throopw%sheol@concert.net\\n               throop%aurgate@concert.net\\n',\n",

Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \\nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \\njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \\nof the hills.\\n\\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \\nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \\nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \\ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \\nmortis. They had been shot.\\n\\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \\nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

We\\nwere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the\\nPalestinian\\'s popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\\nstatement: \"You look for me !\", i.e., I\\'am not making any more\\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid\\'s point of view,\\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\\ngovernment\\'s and his party\\'s lack of action for human rights and\\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists\\'\\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\\n\\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin\\'s\\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\\nmarginal byproduct of this \"government of peace\", which need not\\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \"Rabinic\"\\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\\n\\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\\nto propose except separation: Let\\'s cut ourselves off from the\\nPalestinians, let\\'s build a fence so high that they won\\'t be able\\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\\n\\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha\\'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The\\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\\nseparation and \\'the future of the territories\\', must come to\\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\\n\\'humanitarian\\' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\\nquo>.\\n\\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\\nits burden. [.....].\\n\\n\"Whoover thinks that \\'out of Gaza first\\' is a liberal,\\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\\nthus also disregard responsibility for it\\'s creation. It is very\\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\".\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n>From The OTHER Front, Jerusalem, 10 March 1993\\n\\n',\n",

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\\n\\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".

Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today\\'s modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\"Structure of the State\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \\n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\\n\\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \\n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\\n   high administrative court.\\n\\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Edmonton has been fairly\\nsupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\\nteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\\nthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\\nthan many teams in larger cities did.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\\n  hues, color range and mask.\\n\\nImageStudio: Don\\'t know...\\n\\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\\n\\nDapple Systems\\n--------------\\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\\n\\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W.

Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on\\nthe part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my\\nopinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the\\nJews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this\\nagreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might\\ngrant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but\\nnothing in the archives and available literature indicates that\\nthis was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin\\nMASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the\\nPalestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to\\nyour belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later\\nadvertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was\\nuseful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians\\nwere rightfully scared off, because they did not want another\\nDeir Yassin.  \\n\\tI\\'m not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;\\natrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.\\nIsraelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are\\nand were the good guys in the middle east.

       "  'From: artmel@well.sf.ca.us (Arthur Melnick)\\nSubject: New Encryption Algorithm\\nSummary: The history of NEA\\nKeywords: NEA\\nNntp-Posting-Host: well.sf.ca.us\\nOrganization: The Whole Earth \\'Lectronic Link, Sausalito, CA\\nLines: 76\\n\\n\\n     Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece \"New Encryption\"\\nto sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company,\\nSecured Communications Technologies, Inc, and on encryption\\nalgorithm, NEA.\\n     I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot\\nof ground.  Some of the information in the posting requires some\\nclarification, and I would like to answer some of the questions\\nraised on sci.crypt.\\n     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our\\ntwo main products at this time are a PC based secure\\ncommunications program called SECOM and a general purpose\\nencryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.\\n     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link\\nbetween two PC\\'s connected over dial up telephone lines.  It\\nsupports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard\\nto screen \"chat\".  It has its own proprietary communications\\nprotocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All\\nthough it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be\\ncontinuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.\\n     When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to\\nuse DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export\\napproval for the product because it was perceived that the\\noverseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing\\nopportunity.\\n     We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general\\nexport approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason\\nfor this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something\\nto do with secret government to government agreements which are\\nstill in effect.\\n     In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and\\ndifferent algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This was\\nthe reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.\\n     At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  The\\npreliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to\\nmake it public once the patent process is complete.  All though\\none can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing\\nsecret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is\\nnecessary to let people \"shoot at it\" over an extended period of\\ntime to prove its worth.\\n     In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was\\nnecessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of\\nthe program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a\\nfinished product to submit.\\n     Let me state unequivocally that there is NO \"back door\" to\\nthe program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications\\nTechnologies is a closely held private company and\\nNSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way\\nwhatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.\\n     From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in\\nselling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a\\nback door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our\\ncredibility and our business.\\n     With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set\\nout to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption\\nproducts and systems.  We were able to identify several common\\nthreads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of\\na chip with the encryption algorithm \"cast in silicon\" and\\ncertain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill\\nthe broad range of requirements that we identified.\\n     We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In a\\npress release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:\\n\\n          \"It seems as if the government has an unlimited source\\n     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American\\n     Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security\\n     Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic\\n     spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip\\n     intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying\\n     activities.\"\\n\\n     If they had asked me to put a \"back door\" in NEA I would\\nhave told them to g__ f____ed.\\n     Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES,\\nRSA, IDEA, Diffy-Hellman, PGP, RC2, RC4, or whatever?  I don\\'t\\nknow and probably never will.\\n',\n",

As it turns \\nout, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the \\nsetting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently \\nalso supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to \\nensure the holding of democratic elections in the \\nterritories.\"\\n\\nThus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily \\nHadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the \\nthinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this \\nissue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the \\nsettlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the \\ndecision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian \\npolice force as a significant step towards the instituting of \\nreal autonomy, something which will restrict what can be \\ndone by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza \\nStrip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street \\ntheater on \\'What will happen when there is a Palestinian \\npolice force\\', rightwing elements are attempting to \\nfrighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go \\nback on his decision. Members of the Kach movement \\nhave even begun to organize a \\'settler police force\\' in the \\nOccupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future \\nPalestinian police force.\\n\\nHowever, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the \\nnew police force - as far as the Israeli government is \\nconcerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over \\nwhom they will apparently have no authority, but will \\ncontrol political groups within the Palestinian population, \\nwhom the government is interested in neutralizing. \\nWrites Barzilai:\\n\\n\"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting \\nup of a local police force in the territories will precede, \\nnot only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of \\nthe preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.\\n\\n\"The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a \\nlocal Palestinian police force is evidence that the \\ngovernment is serious about arriving at a settlement with \\nthe Palestinians...\"\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly \\nworried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is \\ninevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal \\nHusseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a \\nvariety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would \\nlike to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the \\nPalestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his \\nplans.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------\\nAdd\\'l comment by E.D.:\\nNumerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in \\nco-opting some Palestinian\\ncircles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police \\nforce, controlled in fact by Israel, might act even more \\nbrutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police \\nforce is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was \\nused by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\\n(1.5).\\n\\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \\n\\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for\\nthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as\\nthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture\\nquality if your dithering works right).\\n\\nI can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to\\nGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.\\nYou don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA\\ncard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+\\ncomputers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a\\n8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write\\nsome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other\\ncolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg\\ndithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette\\nthe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would\\nwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but\\nit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way\\ngives a brighter more detailed image.\\n\\nAnyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as\\nfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the\\nVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)\\n\\nHave a day!\\n\\nGerry.\\n\",\n",

And key size is one of the things that can be\\nverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\\n\\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\\n\\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\\nlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\\nsecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\\nit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\\n(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\\nmembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\\nyou have to XOR together to recover the program...\\n\\nSeriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the\\npeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game\\nand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not\\ngoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility\\nis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied\\nabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence\\nof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will\\nbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.\\nIf they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,\\nno one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.\\n\\nThat isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things\\nanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem\\nwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took\\nfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely\\npossible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just\\nsuch reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to\\na Senator...).\\n\\n> Anyway, its looking like the\\n> keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA\\n> can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number.\\n\\nI don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.\\nHowever -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same\\nescrow agents.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\\n\\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n>Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The\\n>telco isn\\'t supposed to give that without a warrant.  That\\'s the rule\\n>today.\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\\n>judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\\n>without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can\\'t record today\\'s plain\\n>cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\\n>listen to those tapes?\" can they?\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n>>worse, of course, if the government then uses this \"Clinton Clipper\"\\n>>to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption.

You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\\nevery room of one\\'s home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto \\'safeguards\\'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon\\'t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n\\n>This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would\\n>fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so\\n>called \"Digital Telephony\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the\\n>meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext\\n>on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this \\'crisis\\' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n\\'drastic action\\', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don\\'t buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated \\'respected experts\\' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn\\'t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \\nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\\nnear the store. Well at first we didn\\'t know what was happening, and then a\\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What\\'s going on?\" He says, \\n\"What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you see, they\\'ve overturned a car and they\\'re \\nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\\n\\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \\ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn\\'t let them in the building. There were \\nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\\nwere shouting something, but you couldn\\'t understand it. It wasn\\'t one voice \\nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they\\'re breaking glass and \\nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \\nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \\nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\\n\\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \\nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \\nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \\nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \\nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn\\'t want to, but there was \\nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \\nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \\nmicrodistrict.\\n\\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\\n\\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \\nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We\\'re in School No. 33, we need to be \\nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I\\'m sending out help now.\"\\n\\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\\n\\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \\nout, we\\'re here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \\ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \\nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you\\'ll go down there and say that \\nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That\\'s what he did. He went down \\nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \\ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \\nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\\n\\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \\nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \\nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\\n\\nIn the morning we went to my relative\\'s in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \\ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \\nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \\nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn\\'t a single doctor, \\nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \\nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\\n\\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \\nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \\neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \\nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \\nget the things any cheaper.\\n\\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \\nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house.

It's much\\nstronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of\\n160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first\\nstandardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same\\nstrength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less\\nthe beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of\\nvery high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit\\nthat description.\\n\\nWhy n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I\\nhave no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're\\nconstructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.\\nA goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change\\n-- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit\\npatterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_i\\nvalues are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming\\ndistance.\\n\\nIn any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i\\nfrom the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they don't\\nneed to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In\\ntheory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.)\\n\\nThe real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposed\\nto a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is\\n*much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the\\nEFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number\\ngenerator, and that it passed every test you could think of.  When you\\ncome back next week to program some more chips, does it still work that\\nwell?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been\\nchanged out from under you?  Does it still work well the in the\\npresence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards\\nselecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it\\nagain, but that's hard.\\n\\nConsider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your own\\nfloppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's a\\nlot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.\\n(Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too.  I think that they're\\na lot harder.)\\n\\nThere are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not the\\narchitecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,\\nwith one significant exception, is yes.  I really do think that NSA and\\nNIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that\\ntheir real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under\\ncertain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of\\nabuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a\\nprogramming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should be\\nloaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don't\\nclaim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning\\nsufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions\\nsection of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the\\nscheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with\\nimplementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and\\ndue process.  What would you do differently?  In answering this\\nquestion, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both\\nstrong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap\\n*some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to\\nchallenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I\\npresent below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical\\naspects.  And no, I don't by any means claim that just because\\nsomething can be done, it should be.)\\n\\nThe second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually\\ngoing to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't\\nmean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will\\nsubstitute its own chips between the programming facility and the\\nshipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that\\nthe escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,\\nguys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have\\nbought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no\\nanswer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way of\\nanswering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer\\nto the final question, below.\\n\\nThe third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good\\nidea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.\\nI think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil\\nlibertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great\\nlength on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energy\\nto repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some\\nlaws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of\\nindividuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our\\nsystem -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power has\\ncertainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in\\nother cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- but\\nagain, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians\\nto answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of the\\nrest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for those\\nwho give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more\\ndistant from.)\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t--Steve Bellovin\\n\",\n",

Message-digest algorithms\\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\\nauthentication.\\n\\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\\nRivest \\\\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\\\em proved}\\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\\n\\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\\\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\\ninternal compression function, which maps\\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \\na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\\nwould expect.\\n\\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\\nalways involve {\\\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\\n\\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\n\\n\\\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\n\\\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\n\\\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\n\\\\newblock In {\\\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\n\\\\newblock Preprint.\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\\nR.L.

You could do a fast 2:1\\ncompression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about\\nV.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.\\nNow add in the time for your encryption method.  You\\'re going to need\\nsampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a\\nPC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they\\'re so popular and cheap\\n- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the\\nSoundBlaster is that it doesn\\'t seem to be full duplex - you can\\'t\\nsample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation\\na bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be\\nrequired.\\n\\nThe only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the\\nSoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that\\nI don\\'t have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can\\'t\\nestimate how fast a PC you\\'d need.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nNot all men who drink are poets.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\\nmake a real difference.\\n\\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\\n\\n-Peter Lee\\n\\n \\n--\\n/-------------------- Peter E.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \\nassistant general counsel. He became the league\\'s chief legal officer in \\nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the\\nproblem.\\n\\nAnd then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service\\n(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political\\nconnections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if\\nany rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their\\npolticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if\\nthey regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt,\\npeons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty\\nwhen someone questions them.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense.

On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \\n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\\n range could make it 4-5.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \\nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \\nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn\\'t know where I was or how long this \\nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \\nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\\n\\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \\nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I\\'m hallucinating. I am \\nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man\\'s voice is calling\\nme, then a woman\\'s. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \\ntelling him, \"I know that they\\'ve killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \\nher corpse to me so they don\\'t violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn\\'t want to carry the corpse into his \\napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \\nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn\\'t answer their calls. \\nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\\n\\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o\\'clock, and at 9:30 I \\nwent down to the Kasumovs\\'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \\ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \\ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \\nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \\nSabir\\'s son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don\\'t cry, Lyuda\\'s alive!\" He \\nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \\nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir\\'s wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \\napartment. I didn\\'t see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\\nAll of my family had gathered there.\\n   \\nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\\napartment.\\n\\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \\nKarina\\'s in really serious condition, she\\'s probably dying. If she recognizes \\nyou, don\\'t cry, don\\'t tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \\nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \\ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\\nmicrodistrict, that\\'s how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \\nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \\nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \\nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \\nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn\\'t say, but rather muttered something\\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \\nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\\n\\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina\\'s lips. \\nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \\nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \\nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don\\'t know how \\nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She\\'s\\nsaying something to me, but I can\\'t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \\nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \\ncan\\'t write. I can\\'t understand what she\\'s saying. She wanted to tell me \\nsomething, but she couldn\\'t. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\\nthen maybe you\\'ll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\\n\"Maybe it\\'ll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn\\'t\\ncontrol myself.\\n\\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here. I don\\'t think there is a single \\nArmenian left in the building, they\\'ve cut them all up. I\\'m even surprised \\nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it\\'s that serious \\n. . . \" And all the same she\\'s thinking that my emotions are all churned up \\nand that I\\'m fearing for my life, that in fact it\\'s not all that bad. \"OK, \\nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you\\'re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \\nI\\'ll send him over.\"\\n\\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \\nunder Aunt Tanya\\'s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian\\'s apartment. She \\nwasn\\'t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \\neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan\\'s wife is named Tanya too and \\nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he\\'s come home, he\\'s leaving for your \\nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

However,\\n\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\n>>relations.

However \\n>\\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n>\\tI should add few more things.  A.J.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.

As \"Azerbaijan\" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction\\nof western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In\\nparticular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in\\nthe most profitable spheres of manufacture.

But\\nthe chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn\\'t\\nbe submitted for discussion.\\n   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon\\na special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for\\nthe Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn\\'t consider that the deputates have the \\nobjective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the\\nserious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the\\nrepublic\\'s authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,\\nejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion\\non these questions.\\n   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,\\nwhen it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.\\n   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50\\ndeputates (25 \"democrats\" and 25 \"partocrates\"). At that time \"democrats\" and\\n\"partocrates\" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn\\'t exist for a long \\ntime and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections.

For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the\\nlist of one of the military unit\\'s of Russian commandos in Yerevan.\\n   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of\\nthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the\\nRussian community. Azerbaijan\\'s prosecutor\\'s announcement follows, that this\\ntype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--\\n\\n\\nAZERBAIJAN\\'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE\\nSIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan\\nis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six\\naccused soldiers\\' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives\\nof the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation\\nto Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers\\' case will\\nbe directed to Russian parliament.\\n     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give\\nRussian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the\\ninvestigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have\\ngiven rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation\\nin the war against Azerbaijan.\\n\\n\\nARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE \"KARABAKHS\" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of \\nArmenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies\\non the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the\\nnewspaper \"Russky vestnik\" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.\\n     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the \\ndocuments of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of \"reunion\" of\\nthe North Caucasus and \"Armenia proper\" at present, the front is appealing to \\nthe UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the\\nneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.\\n     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to\\ncarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity \"identical to\\nthose in Nagorno Karabakh\". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian\\nnational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of\\nArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus \\ninstructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.\\n     Thus according to the newspaper \"Russky vestnik\", \"new Karabakhs\" are \\nbeing planning on the North Caucasus. --O--\\n\\n\\nSTATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of\\nAzerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural\\ncenters was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president\\nElchibey\\'s decree on state assistance for the development of language and\\nculture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. \\n     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a\\nlegal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership\\nof Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all \\nnationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.\\n     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,\\nHidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the \"undeclared\\nwar\" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many \\nproblems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic\\ngroups. \\n     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of\\nJustice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture \\nand means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign\\ndiplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of\\nfree accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). \\n     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted\\nto create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of\\nAzerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, \\nradiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the\\neducational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national\\nteaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences\\nof Azerbaijan.--O-- \\n\\n\\nMEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State \\nconcern \"Azerineft\", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies\\n\"AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum\", \"Bi-Pi Exploration Operating\", \"Pennzoil\\nCaspian\", \"Unocal Khazar Ltd.\", \"McDermott\" and Turkish oil corporation on\\nmutual extracting of fields \"Azeri\", \"Chirag\" and \"Gyuneshli\" was signed. \\nAccording to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common\\nprogram of activity was created. \\n     According to the president of \"Azerineft\", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation\\nwill provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. \\n     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of\\noil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of\\nexploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the\\nexploitation of these fields. \\nThe memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical\\nand political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas\\nfields. --O--\\n\\n\\nARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on \\nsix Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,\\nArmenian propaganda has become actively involved.\\n     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin\\nwith a request \"to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian\\nsoldiers\". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings\\non the case in Baku as \"a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia\".\\n     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could\\nbelieve the Yerevan agency \"Snark\", the Armenians in Karabakh presented\\nan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum\\nis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in\\nKarabakh will be shot dead.\\n     It is simple to explain such \"touching attitude of Armenians\" to\\nthe six Russian soldiers\\' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed\\nit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused\\nRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister\\nof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.\\n     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its\\nsaving of lives of \"innocent Russians\". --O--\\n\\n\\nNEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of\\nAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan\\nfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.\\n     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,\\nNyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from\\nKafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were\\ndestructions in the villages.\\n     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,\\nShynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of\\nAzerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in\\nprogress.\\n     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of\\nArmenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated\\ninto the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two\\nshepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a\\nflock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--\\n\\n\\n\"UNOCAL\" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the\\nrepresentation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this\\ncompany decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of\\n50 houses for refugees.\\n     At present, the American side suggested a village project for \\nconsideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project\\nis a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary\\naccommodations and so on.\\n     According to the program the construction and putting into\\noperation of the village will be this year. --O--\\n\\n\\nMANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the\\nnational currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian\\nRuble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.\\nTaking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with \\nrespect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value\\n10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is\\nthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.\\n     According to the representatives of the business circles and\\nexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles\\nare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial\\noperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics\\nof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen\\narrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business \\nwith Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much \\nRubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--\\n\\n\\nTHE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY\\n\\n    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president\\'s decree, the\\nexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and \\npresidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution\\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before\\nthe Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new\\nConstitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of\\nthe country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the\\npress-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.\\n    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and \\nrepresentatives of the department of the president\\'s apparatus Fazil Mustafaev\\nand Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.\\n    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary\\nelection law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill\\ndidn\\'t cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative\\nvariant of the election law was put forward.\\n   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions\\nwill examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all\\nproposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--\\n\\n\\nISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR \\nCLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED\\n\\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the\\nAzerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman\\nof the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with\\nthe conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant\\nK. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the\\nSupreme Court of Azerbaijan.\\n   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan\\nMilly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme\\nSoviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal\\ncase. In his view, \"the conclusion of the commission could help in the \\nobjective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems\\nin the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the\\nknowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime\".\\n   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,\\nMilly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the\\npermanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human\\nrights and international relations are charged with the exploration of\\nthis problem.--0--\\n\\n\\nWILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?\\n\\n      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative\\nto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the \\nTrilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with\\nthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case\\nthe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin\\'s initiative itself.\\n     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors\\nof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is\\npaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from\\nthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and\\nUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial\\nUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--\\n\\n\\nFATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER\\n\\n   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,\\nSabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of\\noil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.\\nAs it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-\\nRAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian\\nfields.\\n   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete\\ntreaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and\\nPENNZOIL will sign treaties.\\n   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645\\nmillion ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton\\non Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.\\n   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to\\nbring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net\\neconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in\\nthe defence of its interests at the international scene.\\n   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement \"the May of\\n1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its\\nindependence and we have to stand these tests\".--0--\\n\\nTHE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN\\n\\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan\\ninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the\\nRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.\\nThe appeal contains the call \"to display mercy, humanism and clemency \\non the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed\\nForces\".\\n   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don\\'t justify the\\nparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,\\ndon\\'t call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce\\nthe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the\\nRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.\\n    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers\\'\\nmothers\\' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the\\npresident of Azerbaijan to \"save those guys\".\\n   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers\\' mothers,\\ntaking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only\\nRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down\\nlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made\\nanswerable.\\n    Unfortunately, the appeal didn\\'t mention the grief of the mothers\\nof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--\\n\\n\\nARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of\\nAzerbaijan were killed during the \"Grad\" shelling of the villages of\\nKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of\\nthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.\\n     The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of\\nTovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire\\nfrom the territory of Armenia. There are destructions. \\n     The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated. \\nOn May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the\\nvillage of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipment\\nto this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is setting\\nup a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by\\nvillages.\\n     According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentration\\nof man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky\\ndistrict of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the\\nfrontier with Fizuli district. --O--\\n\\n\\nAZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN\\n\\n  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,\\nRauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that\\n\"Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan\\nafter Iran\". The business cooperation between the two countries\\ndevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil\\nextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.\\n  According to the Minister\\'s words, the forthcoming visit of\\nAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May\\n23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will\\nhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch\\noffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude\\ncontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on\\nbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the\\nentire communication system of Azerbaijan.\\n   In Garayev\\'s view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain\\nwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.\\n   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great\\nBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\\n------------------------------------------------\\nPostal Address:\\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\\nFax: (408) 991-3773\\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\\n\\n\",\n",

First, let me\\nflame the famous Dave S. : He\\'s obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him\\nsome slack. :^}\\n\\nThe joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job\\nguys!  I\\'ve been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years\\nnow, Clinton\\'s actions so far have really helped.  But because of\\ngovernment action taken against various other groups, I have developed\\na 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.\\nThe S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57\\nbased on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it\\nslows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a\\ndifferent set of s-boxes, I know it\\'s only a vector, but it sure makes\\nrandom search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had\\ntheir mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug\\nuse/sales.  It\\'s not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,\\n*but* you will be watched.\\n\\nIt really is important to write a letter to every official you\\npersonally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by\\nthe \"cripple chip\".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get\\n*enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and\\nthe IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we\\n*are* seeing some changes.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the\\nimplimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselin\\npoints out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be\\nagain depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns\\nand \"law abiding\" citizens don\\'t, and criminals like me have marijuana\\nand \"law abiding\" subjects don\\'t, criminals like me will have secure\\ncrypto while \"law abiding\" robots don\\'t.  PGP is nice, but as time goes\\non we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.\\n\\nSomeone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He\\'s my favorite dude.\\n500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain\\nthat to \"princes\" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted\\n(I\\'ve got \"The Prince\" at home, so I\\'ll just paraphrase :) ) had to do\\nwith conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*\\nit.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept\\nthe people\\'s customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people\\nwill remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive\\ngovernment.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*\\nThomas Jefferson.\\n\\nThere were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic\\nis watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords\\nlike marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known\\nsubversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if\\nyou know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it\\'s pretty easy\\nto go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the\\nless you\\'re noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization\\nwhich can diseminate truth to the masses.\\n\\nWhich gets me to the thread about a \"public encrypted conference\".\\nThat\\'s just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an\\ninfiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you\\'re doing.  It will be\\nfun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it\\'s\\npretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where\\nyou get your marijuana.\\n\\nGuns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in\\ngovernment who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in\\nalt.drugs \"Live free or don\\'t\".  Machiavelli pointed out that\\'s just\\nhow most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.\\nIt\\'s true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as\\nIntergraph\\'s!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the\\nU.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots\\ncalled bureaucrats and there\\'s less to worry about than one might\\nthink.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be\\nhurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.\\nde Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the\\nmajority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.\\n\\nAnd given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne\\nNational Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.\\n\\nPatience, persistence, truth,\\t\\twork: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov\\nDr. mike\\t\\t\\t\\thome: mrosing@igc.org\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQBVAgUBK9hETK3mm/E84rLHAQFV+gH9ExvzfXbNR4x0BTg2nQIxB5/ZMaxT289B\\nG4QjTsv8mszMrzU1DcJ8eLIQ37BwX53jATBH9U4B/biqmGKiPzHCmA==\\n=S3hf\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n',\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\\n\\n--------\\n\\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\\n\\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\\'s ONLY if you restrict\\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\\nsecond derivative.

Very simple, there are some\\n  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects\\n  floating in various FTP sites. There\\'s also a previewer written in\\n  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there\\'s one written in VOGLE, so you can\\n  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.\\n  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)\\n\\nOFF\\n---\\n  Object file format, from DEC\\'s Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).\\n[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,\\n I\\'ll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]\\n\\n  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this\\n  service, send a message with a \"Subject:\" line containing only the word\\n  \"help\" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.\\n  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There\\'s an OFF\\n  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in\\n  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,\\n  also on gondwana.\\n\\nTDDD\\n----\\nIt\\'s a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,\\nRayshade, Imagine or vort objects.\\nEdited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):\\n\\n  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley\\n  (worley@cup.portal.com)\\n\\n  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format\\n  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,\\n  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely\\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\\n\\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various\\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables\\n  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views\\n  in Postscript.\\n\\nP3D\\n---\\n  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight\\n  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp\\n  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to\\n  have access to any vendor\\'s lisp to run this software.\\n\\n  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon\\n  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D\\n  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.\\n\\n  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:\\n  Painter - Painter\\'s Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,\\n  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from\\n  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.\\n\\n  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines\\n  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory\\n  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.\\n\\nRenderMan\\n---------\\n  Pixar\\'s RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\n8.

IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid\\n  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987\\n  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at\\n  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325\\n  and the cost is $100.\\n  This standard is not available in electronic format.\\n\\nc. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only\\n  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.\\n  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get\\n  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov\\n  and putting the line\\n\\tsend index\\n  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.\\n\\n  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working\\n  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,\\n  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.\\n  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.\\n\\n  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),\\n  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or\\n          mm%inf.rl.ac.uk@NSFnet-relay.ac.uk\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\nEnd of Part 1 of the Resource Listing\\n-- \\nNick (Nikolaos) Fotis         National Technical Univ. of Athens, Greece\\nHOME: 16 Esperidon St.,       InterNet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr\\n      Halandri, GR - 152 32   UUCP:    mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis\\n      Athens, GREECE          FAX: (+30 1) 77 84 578\\n',\n",

Questions to Israelis\\n\\n\\nDear Josh\\n\\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\\n\\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\\n\\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\\n\\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\\nYou did not respond to my question.\\n\\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\\n\\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\\nMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases\\nlike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about\\nthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and\\nimprisoned.\\n\\n5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status\\nof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I\\nunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for\\nthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).\\nThe law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,\\nwhy doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?\\n\\n6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return\\nconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands\\nof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under\\nIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from\\nreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also\\nleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to\\nreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?\\nIs the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge\\nsomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in\\nhis homeland ?\\n\\n7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an\\norder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that\\ninformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all\\ninhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These\\nexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other\\natrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by\\nIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the\\nPalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University\\nPress. Is this book available in your library ?\\n\\n8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in\\nIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very\\nlittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, many\\nArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are\\nnot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want\\nArabs ?\\n\\n9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was\\nwhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to\\ndiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but\\nevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants\\nto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious\\ncommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish\\ncivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests\\nto officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a\\nsecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.\\n\\n\\nI would be glad to have some more input from you after these\\ncomments.\\n\\nElias\\n\\n\",\n",

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
